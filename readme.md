# Credit Risk Classification
## Description
This analysis aims to predict health of the loan based on several factors: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt to income.

Logistic Regression models were used to predict the credit risk.

## Data
The project [data]('Resources/lending_data.csv') is based on a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Technology
Python libs: sklearn, pandas, numpy. Jupyter Notebooks.
